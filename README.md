# Implicit-Entity-Linking-in-Tweets-Resources-and-Dataset

# Overview
This repository includes a gold standard dataset containing 7870 tweets for the task of implicit entity recognition and classification. The publication pertinent to the preliminary work that serves as the bases of the present work is titled "Implicit Entity Linking through Ad-hoc Retrieval". 
Moreover, a manuscript as an extension to the aforementioned publication titled "Implicit Entity Linking in Tweets: an Ad-hoc Retrieval Approach" has been submitted for a journal publication.

The source codes and data pertinent to "Implicit Entity Linking in Tweets: an Ad-hoc Retrieval Approach" can be found in this repository as described below. Additionally, the abstract and more detailed explanation of this research work can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/HawreH/Implicit-Entity-Recognition-and-Linking-in-Tweets-Resources-and-Dataset/wiki) of this repository.



# Dataset
This [gold standard dataset for implicit entity recognition, classification and linking](https://github.com/HawreH/Implicit-Entity-Recognition-and-Linking-in-Tweets-Resources-and-Dataset/tree/master/Dataset) contains 7870 tweets of three categories of *Implicit*, *Explicit*, and *NIL*.

A two-level taxonomy comprised of fine-grained and coarse-grained class levels has been designed for structuring and collection of our gold standard dataset. Our taxonomy contains 7 coarse-grained entity types, namely PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, PRODUCT, EVENT, and WORK. These tags and the fine-grained classes pertinent to each tag are based on the DBpedia taxonomy.

Tagged tweets have been collected in a four-month time frame spanning from October 2017 to January 2018. We maintain such information as tweet ID, user ID, date, and so forth.
